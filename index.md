# Stuff

This blog serves as a place for me to:

- explore random thoughts
- learn and play with Markdown & Jekyll
- play with some of the principles of minimalist/brutalist design
- maybe expand my knowledge in various areas of interest
- serve as a stepping stone for other, bigger projects I have in mind
