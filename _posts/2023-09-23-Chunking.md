# Chunking

<!-- Does thought need to be represented as a formal system for the idea of chunking to be valid? -->

The idea of "Chunking" in psychology is the grouping of items and reperceiving them as a single "chunk". It abstracts the general function, or identity, of the cluster, away from the internal structure.

Ignoring nuances of the inner workings alleviates cognitive load, making conceptualizing concepts on a higher level easier.

We can chunk the last section, a-b-i, even further and the result is just a single node that represents the item while ignoring the nuances of its internal structure or functions:
